📌 Project Description
Book Nest is a full-stack web application designed to simulate a modern, responsive online bookstore. Developed using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), it allows users to explore, search, and securely purchase books from a large catalog. The application emphasizes seamless navigation, real-time updates, and personalized user experiences.
🛠️ Skills and Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Tools: Postman, MongoDB Compass, GitHub, VS Code
📝 Planning Phase
Objectives:
•	- Develop a book store platform using the MERN stack
- Enable user registration, login, and session handling
- Provide search, filter, and sorting mechanisms for books
- Implement secure cart and checkout functionality
- Track and display order history
- Allow admin to manage book inventory
Modules:
•	- User Authentication and Authorization

🧠 Problem & Solution Phase
Problem	Solution
Physical bookstores are time-restricted and limited	Offer 24/7 online access to books
Inefficient manual inventory and order tracking	Backend automation for inventory and order status
Users want personalized recommendations	Include filters for genres, ratings, and authors
Security of user data during transactions	Implement JWT-based authentication and HTTPS
Lack of user engagement	Provide responsive design and easy navigation
🧪 Testing Phase
Testing Strategies:
•	- Unit Testing: React components, utility functions
- API Testing: CRUD operations and authentication (Postman)
- Integration Testing: Frontend-backend communication
- UI/UX Testing: Manual responsiveness and usability tests
- Database Testing: MongoDB queries, schema validation
Sample Test Cases:
Feature	Test Case	Expected Output	Status
User Signup	Register with valid data	Account created and redirected	Pass
Login Auth	Invalid credentials	Error message shown	Pass
Book Search	Search by keyword	Filtered books displayed	Pass
Cart	Add book to cart	Appears in cart with correct details	Pass
Order	Place an order	Confirmation with order ID	Pass
Role Access	Access admin route as user	Access denied	Pass
